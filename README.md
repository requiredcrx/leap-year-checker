# Leap Year Checker
A simple program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not. This is my day 2 project in my 100 days of coding course.

## Requirements
+ Python 3

## Usage
To use the program, clone this repository and run the leap_year.py script with a year as an argument:
```
git clone https://github.com/user/leap-year-checker.git
cd leap-year-checker
python leap_year.py 2020
```
The program will print out whether the given year is a leap year or not.

## How it works
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. This program uses this rule to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not.
